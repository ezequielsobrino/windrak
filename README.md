# Windrak
================

Windrak is a powerful command-line tool that combines advanced file operations with the capabilities of modern Language Models (LLMs). This tool is designed to enhance development workflows by automating tasks, providing insightful analysis, and generating content directly from the command line.

## Features

*   **Automated Pull Request Creation**: Windrak can create pull requests with automatically generated titles and descriptions based on the changes made to the repository.
*   **README File Generation**: Windrak can generate a detailed README file for your repository, including information about the project structure, features, and usage.
*   **Integration with GitHub and Groq APIs**: Windrak uses the GitHub API to interact with your repositories and the Groq API to generate high-quality content.

## Installation

To install Windrak, you can use pip:

```bash
pip install .
```

## Configuration

Before using Windrak, you need to set up your GitHub token and Groq API key as environment variables. You can do this by running the following commands:

```bash
export GITHUB_TOKEN=your_github_token_here
export GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here
```

Replace `your_github_token_here` and `your_groq_api_key_here` with your actual GitHub token and Groq API key.
