# Windrak

Windrak is a powerful command-line tool that combines advanced file operations with the capabilities of modern Language Models (LLMs). This tool is designed to enhance development workflows by automating tasks, providing insightful analysis, and generating content directly from the command line.

## Features

* **Automated Pull Request Creation**: Windrak can create pull requests with automatically generated titles and descriptions based on the changes made to the repository.
* **README File Generation**: Windrak can generate a detailed README file for your repository, including information about the project structure, features, and usage.
* **Integration with GitHub and Groq APIs**: Windrak uses the GitHub API to interact with your repositories and the Groq API to generate high-quality content.

## Installation

To install Windrak, you can use pip:

```bash
pip install windrak
```

After installation, you need to set up your Groq API key as an environment variable. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal, replacing "your-groq-api-key" with your actual API key:

```bash
export GROQ_API_KEY="your-groq-api-key"
```

## Configuration

Before using Windrak, you also need to set up your GitHub token as an environment variable. You can do this by running the following command:

```bash
export GITHUB_TOKEN=your_github_token_here
```

Replace `your_github_token_here` with your actual GitHub token.

## Usage

Windrak provides two main commands: `create-pr` and `create-readme`.

### Create Pull Request

To create a pull request, use the following command:

```bash
windrak create-pr
```

This command will create a pull request with an automatically generated title and description based on the changes made to the repository.

### Create README File

To generate a README file, use the following command:

```bash
windrak create-readme
```

This command will generate a detailed README file for your repository, including information about the project structure, features, and usage.
