# Windrak

## Project Name
Windrak is a CLI tool for advanced file operations with LLM capabilities.

## Brief Description
Windrak is designed to simplify the process of creating and managing README files for projects. It uses a combination of natural language processing to generate high-quality README content.

## Main Features
* Generate expert-level README files for projects
* Support for multiple sections, including project description, main features, prerequisites, installation, usage, examples, project structure, API reference, contribution guidelines, troubleshooting, changelog, license, and contact information
* Integration with LLM capabilities for generating high-quality content

## Prerequisites
* Python 3.7+
* Groq API key

## Installation
To install Windrak, you can use pip:

```bash
pip install windrak
```

After installation, you need to set up your Groq API key as an environment variable. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal, replacing "your-groq-api-key" with your actual API key:

```bash
export GROQ_API_KEY="your-groq-api-key"
```

## Usage
To generate a README file for your project, use the following command:
```bash
windrak create-readme --path /path/to/your/project --output README.md
```
Replace `/path/to/your/project` with the actual path to your project directory, and `README.md` with the desired output file name.

## Examples
Here are some examples of using Windrak:

* Generate a README file for a project in the current directory:
  ```bash
  windrak create-readme --path . --output README.md
  ```
* Generate a README file for a project in a specific directory:
  ```bash
  windrak create-readme --path /path/to/your/project --output README.md
  ```
* Generate a README file with custom sections:
  ```bash
  windrak create-readme --path . --output README.md --sections "1. Project Name, 2. Brief Description, 3. Main Features"
  ```

## Data Privacy and Security
**Important:** Windrak uses the Groq API for generating README content, which means that information about your project is sent to Groq's servers for processing. Please be aware of the following:

1. **Confidential Code:** Avoid sending confidential or proprietary code to the Groq API. The README generation process should focus on high-level descriptions and publicly shareable information.

2. **Sensitive Data:** Do not include sensitive data, such as API keys, passwords, or personal information, in the project files that are processed by Windrak.

3. **Review Generated Content:** Always review the generated README content before committing it to your project to ensure no sensitive information has been inadvertently included.

4. **API Key Security:** Keep your Groq API key secure and never share it publicly. Use environment variables or secure secret management tools to handle the API key.

5. **Data Retention:** Familiarize yourself with Groq's data retention and privacy policies to understand how your project information may be handled.

By using Windrak, you acknowledge that you are responsible for ensuring the security and privacy of your project information when interacting with external APIs.

## How to Contribute
Contributing to Windrak involves enhancing its CLI capabilities, such as adding new commands or improving existing ones. Hereâ€™s a detailed guide on how to add new commands to the Windrak CLI:

1. **Fork the Repository**: Start by forking the Windrak repository on GitHub to your own account. This allows you to make changes without affecting the original project.
2. **Clone Your Fork**: Clone the forked repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/windrak.git
   ```
3. **Set Up Your Development Environment**:
   * Navigate to the cloned repository.
   * Install the required dependencies:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

4. **Create a New Branch**: Make a new branch for your changes:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b add-your-new-command
   ```
5. **Develop Your New Command**:
   * Add your new command script in the `src/windrak` directory. Refer to the structure of existing commands, like `create_readme.py`, for guidance.
   * Update `src/windrak/cli.py` to include your new command in the CLI group.
   * Ensure that your command handles user input appropriately and integrates seamlessly with the Groq API if needed.

6. **Test Your Command**: Ensure that your command works as expected. You can manually test it by running the Windrak CLI locally.
7. **Commit and Push Your Changes**:
   * Add your changes to git:
     ```bash
     git add .
     ```
   * Commit your changes:
     ```bash
     git commit -m "Add new CLI command: your-command"
     ```
   * Push your branch to GitHub:
     ```bash
     git push origin add-your-new-command
     ```
8. **Open a Pull Request (PR)**:
   * Go to the original Windrak repository on GitHub.
   * Click on 'Pull Requests' and then the 'New pull request' button.
   * Select your branch and provide a description of your changes.
   * Submit the PR for review by the repository maintainers.
9. **Respond to Feedback**: If the repository maintainers have any feedback or require changes to your pull request, make the necessary adjustments and update your PR.
