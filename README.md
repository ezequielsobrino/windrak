# Windrak
================

## Project Name
Windrak is a CLI tool for advanced file operations with LLM capabilities.

## Brief Description
Windrak is designed to simplify the process of creating and managing README files for projects. It uses a combination of natural language processing and machine learning to generate high-quality README content.

## Main Features
*   Generate expert-level README files for projects
*   Support for multiple sections, including project description, main features, prerequisites, installation, usage, examples, project structure, API reference, contribution guidelines, troubleshooting, changelog, license, and contact information
*   Integration with LLM capabilities for generating high-quality content
*   Customizable sections and content

## Prerequisites
*   Python 3.7+
*   Groq API key
*   directory-info-extractor library
*   click library
*   python-dotenv library

## Installation
To install Windrak, follow these steps:

1.  Clone the repository using the following command:
    ```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/windrak.git
```
2.  Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
cd windrak
```
3.  Install the required dependencies using pip:
    ```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
4.  Create a new file named `.env` and add your Groq API key:
    ```makefile
GROQ_API_KEY="your-groq-api-key"
```
5.  Run the installation script:
    ```bash
python setup.py install
```

## Usage
To generate a README file for your project, use the following command:
```bash
windrak create-readme --path /path/to/your/project --output README.md
```
Replace `/path/to/your/project` with the actual path to your project directory, and `README.md` with the desired output file name.

*   Generate a README file for a project in the current directory:
    ```bash
windrak create-readme --path . --output README.md
```

    ```bash
windrak create-readme --path /path/to/your/project --output README.md
```
*   Generate a README file with custom sections:
    ```bash
windrak create-readme --path . --output README.md --sections "1. Project Name, 2. Brief Description, 3. Main Features"
```
